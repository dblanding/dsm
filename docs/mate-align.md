# Aligning & Mating components

* It's pretty common when creating a mechanical design to use off-the-shelf components. After all, we generally aren't trying to re-invent the wheel. When we shop for components, it's super easy to download a STEP file and drop it into our design.

* But there's a little more to it than just dropping a STEP file into our design. We also need to position it properly (in 2 respects).
    1. It needs to be positioned within the assembly structure, so that it becomes a component of the desired subassembly.
    2. It needs to be positioned properly in X, Y, Z space, so that it fits correctly among the neighboring components in our design.

## So how do we do this?

* There is a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yrhunri-HE) showing how it's done in **SpaceClaim**. It looks like fun. But unfortunately, when SpaceClaim collaborated with RS to come up with DesignSpark Mechanical, they didn't include that functionality in DSM.
* But, all is not lost. As it turns out, it can still be done in DSM, it's just not well documented.
* You have to use the **Move Tool** and a few of its **Tool Guides**.
* This [simple example](mate-align-dsm.md) shows how to do it, step by step.
* I also show it in this video:
