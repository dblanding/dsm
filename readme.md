# Exploration of [DesignSpark](https://www.rs-online.com/designspark/home) Mechanical CAD
* DesignSpark Mechanical (Version 6) [just became available in January 2023](https://www.eejournal.com/industry_news/rs-unveils-next-phase-of-designspark-engineering-community-offering-enhanced-and-personalised-resources/).
    * According to Wikipedia, "DesignSpark Mechanical is based on the SpaceClaim Engineer application and is the product of a collaboration between RS Components and Ansys, Inc."
    * Earlier versions of DesignSpark have been *free* but have had some "add-on" options ($) available to make it more useful.
    * I do remember looking at it at version 4, and thinking that it came up short of my needs.
    * **Not any more**. Version 6 is now a fully capable stand-alone professional CAD application.
* Signed up for 7-day free trial of CREATOR Plan ($12/mo) 
* Registered and created an account
    * Used my email as username
* Downloaded & installed on Windows 10
* This [10-minute "Gee Whiz" video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXgMY3-hlgs) (by a former Solid Works user) showcases some of the amazing power of DS Mechanical

## My notes on [Learning to use DSM](docs/learning.md)

## What is it exactly that makes DSM such an obvious and compelling choice?
* Reason #1: It uses a sophisticated **Direct Modeling** kernel, allowing it to be extremely easy to learn and easy to use. This [CAD kernel Primer](docs/kernel-primer.md) should help you appreciate the importance of this.
 
* Reason #2: It is **Very Affordable**

> Always choose high quality tools, not only because they will help you do a job faster, easier, safer and better, but because they are a joy to use.
